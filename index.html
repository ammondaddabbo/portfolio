        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I joined the military when I was 17 years of age. I spent 6 years as a Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) member, 2 of which I was a qualified Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC). I worked closely with the U.S. Army Ground Commanders and the U.S. Air Force attack aircraft to coordinate air strikes on enemy targets. I was extensively trained in telecommunications, targeting, navigation, and a plethera of enhanced technical equipment. After getting injured on a deployment to Afghanistan I decided to seperate from the military to persue other career avenues.</p>
        <p>I started to learn web programming as a hobbie, for stress relief. As I began to pursue it, I found it relaxing, even as it taxed my intelect. I found it a refreshing pastime activity, liken to a jigsaw puzzle. I am blatantly aware of my reletively small knowledge bank in the realm of web programming, yet I look forward to the furture challenges of my personal and professional growth.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I would eventually like to create my own web programming and design business and work for myself. Yet, until that day, I look forward to working for, and with, anyone who can help me hone my skills. I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>

          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My objective is to secure a position that utilizes my interests and expertise in providing exceptional care, service, and work ethic while challenging my intellect and forcing education through experience. </p>
